Title:
  HealthCare Imaging Analysis
  
  Purpose:
    The purpose of this program is to process medical or grayscale images by applying basic computer vision techniques such as preprocessing, edge detection, and segmentation. It helps enhance visual features that can aid in analysis or diagnosis.
    
Applications:

This type of image processing pipeline has several real-world applications, especially in the medical imaging field:

*Tumor boundary detection in MRI or CT scans.

*Cell segmentation in microscopic images.

*X-ray image enhancement for better diagnosis.

*Skin lesion analysis in dermatology.

*Any field requiring structure recognition in grayscale images.

Technology Used:

Python: Programming language used for implementing the logic.

OpenCV (cv2): Library for image processing operations like blurring, edge detection, thresholding, and contour handling.

Matplotlib: For displaying images side by side in an organized layout.

Google Colab: Cloud-based platform that supports Python and allows image upload and visualization.

Usage:
1. Run the code in Google Colab.
2. Upload a grayscale image or a medical image when prompted.
3. The program:

Loads and preprocesses the image.
Detects edges using the Canny algorithm.
Segments the image using thresholding.
Displays all stages side-by-side for analysis.
This process provides visual insight into how raw images can be transformed into feature-rich representations for further use.

Conclusion:
The program demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to image analysis using fundamental computer vision techniques. It showcases how preprocessing, edge detection, and segmentation can be combined to extract meaningful features from grayscale or medical images. This serves as a foundational step toward building more advanced diagnostic or AI-assisted tools in medical imaging and related fields.
